      Dota, an acronym for the name Defense of the Ancients, is a type of
      strategy game that focuses on team-play and map-coordination. Originally a
      mod for another game, Warcraft 3, the mod quickly exploded in popularity
      and rose to the most played custom map in warcraft 3's online play.

      The game focuses on two sides, the Radian and the Dire, who's goal is to
      destroy each other's towers until they reach and destroy the opposing
      nexus. Players themselves choose their hero from a large pool of
      characters who each have their own unique spells and stats. These heroes
      are separated into 3 different groups based on their primary stats:
      Strength, Agility, and Intelligence. Each hero has their own purpose on a
      team, and this creates an emphasis on the drafting phase as there are
      often heroes who are strong and weak against each other respectively.
      Strength heroes are often initiators and gankers(flankers) due to their
      high health pools and general strength in the earlier stages of the game.
      Agility heroes are often considered "hard carries", which means that they
      scale with items purchaseable in the shop the best, and their main stat,
      agility, becomes the strongest as the game goes on. Intelligence heroes
      are usually considered mages and supports who have access to powerful
      spells; however, due to the nature of spell damage in this game being
      static this usually means they are quite powerful earlier into the game
      and lose strength as the game progresses, but make up for this with the
      powerful crowd control(roots, stuns, slows, silences...) that the spells
      provide to keep the relevant in the game.
